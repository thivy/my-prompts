This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This repo is configured to export a static site and deploy to GitHub Pages via Actions.

1. In GitHub, go to Settings â†’ Pages and set Source to GitHub Actions.
2. Ensure your default branch is `main`.
3. Push to `main`. The workflow `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` will:
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` to the repository name.
   - Run `next build` (static export to `out/`).
   - Publish `out/` to Pages.

Local export test (PowerShell):

```powershell
$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH = "<your-repo-name>"
npm run build
```

Then open `out/index.html` or serve `out/` with a static server to verify.
