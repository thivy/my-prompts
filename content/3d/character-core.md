A 3D cartoon-style render of a **[CHARACTER SEED]**, designed with a whimsical yet premium aesthetic.Silhouette emphasizes stylized proportions, expressive features, and distinctive thematic accessories. Pose conveys charm and personality, suited for a balanced square composition.

## Visual Direction

Playful, imaginative atmosphere blending fantasy and cohesive color storytelling.  
Primary palette adapts naturally to the character’s theme, supported by one or two high‑contrast accent hues.  
Visual style draws from children’s storybook illustration, gentle surrealism, and character-driven worldbuilding.

## Materials, Lighting & Atmosphere

Surface treatments and textures tailored to the concept — from soft matte translucency to patterned or organic detail.  
Lighting combines ambient fills with highlights to enhance depth, tactility, and visual focus.  
Background uses a gradient or complementary tone to cleanly frame the subject within the square format.

## Camera Setup

Framed in a centered, medium-close shot for a 1:1 aspect ratio.  
Depth of field isolates the face or key accessory while keeping secondary details softly visible.  
Slight camera tilt or dynamic crop adds storytelling energy without breaking square balance.
