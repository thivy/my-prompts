A mischievous baby dragon with iridescent jade scales and oversized goggles zooms through a candy-colored twilight sky on a whimsically crooked broomstick. Its wings, too small for flight, flap enthusiastically as it clings to the broom with stubby claws, trailing a cascade of sparkling stardust. The broomstick, whimsically warped and etched with ancient runes, is festooned with mismatched ribbons and tiny wind chimes that tinkle in the breeze. Below, floating islands drift lazily, dotted with glowing mushrooms and curious creatures peeking out.

The atmosphere is a blend of playful chaos and serene magic, bathed in soft, pastel light that casts long shadows and glints off the dragon’s gleeful grin.
