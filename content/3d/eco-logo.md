Create an image of Macro Diorama of Official **"[LOGO]"** Logo

## Core Composition

The logo’s exact silhouette and proportions are sculpted from compacted dark soil and layered stone for geological depth. Outer faces are carpeted with lush, slightly overgrown grass. Official brand colours map precisely to each segment, with no distortion or reinterpretation.

## Miniature Natural Accents

On flat surfaces or edges, place two bonsai‑scale trees with foliage tinted to exactly match the **primary brand colours** of the logo — each tree aligning with a key palette segment for bold, harmonious contrast. Include a small wooden hut or rustic fence, and 2–3 fluffy white clouds. All accents are scaled to preserve the macro‑world illusion without disrupting the logo’s geometry.

## Visual Direction

A fusion of whimsical eco‑sculpture and hyper‑real tilt‑shift photography. The scene feels tranquil yet alive, with premium tactile realism. Octane Render is preferred for lifelike grass, moss, haze, and cinematic depth.

## Materials, Lighting & Atmosphere

### Materials

Grass shows fine blade detail and natural light diffusion; soil is rich with pebbles and moss; stone has a matte finish with mineral flecks; tree foliage retains natural texture but exactly matches brand hues; wood features weathered grain and subtle highlights.

### Lighting

Warm, soft key light from upper left, gentle fill from lower right, and optional rim light to outline the silhouette.

### Atmosphere

Neutral warm‑gray backdrop with light volumetric haze around clouds; no clutter to distract from the logo.

## Camera Setup

Macro 85 mm lens with shallow depth of field focused mid‑logo. Square 1:1 framing, slightly top‑weighted, light vertical blur for miniature effect. Render at minimum 8K for texture fidelity.
