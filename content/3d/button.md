Create an image of a sleek, modern, and minimalistic horizontally elongated oval button, positioned centrally on a solid background with a color of **[white]**. The form should have a refined, high-end feel, with balanced proportions, gentle curves, and harmonious symmetry that communicates precision. The perspective must be perfectly front-facing, with the viewer looking directly at the object at eye level, ensuring no tilt or angle. The button should have a confident, streamlined silhouette with an ultra-thin outer edge, allowing the glass surface to dominate visually. The glass must cover the entire surface area of the button, edge to edge, with no visible base or backing.

## Materials, Lighting & Atmosphere

The button’s edge should feature a barely visible, ultra-thin chrome rim — just enough to define the boundary without interrupting the visual flow. The entire button body should be encased in a fully shiny, translucent glass shell with a smooth, rounded capsule shape — gently curved along all axes, with softened ends and a continuous, fluid contour. The glass must be extremely reflective and refractive, with a liquid-like appearance that mimics surface tension holding a perfect droplet in place. The edges of the glass should be thin and seamless, tapering gently into the surrounding space to create a soft, floating effect. Highlights should ripple organically across the surface, with soft distortions and flowing reflections that evoke the behavior of water or molten crystal. Apply a tint color to the glass of **[#rainbow]**, and set its transparency to **[10%]**, allowing the background and lighting to subtly pass through the surface while maintaining a gentle hue. Lighting should be soft and diffused from above and slightly forward, casting luminous gradients and dynamic specular reflections across the glass. A secondary fill ensures the contours remain visible, while rim lighting subtly outlines the capsule shape and enhances the sense of fluidity. The atmosphere should remain minimal and premium, with the solid background providing contrast and clarity.

## Camera Setup

Use an 85mm equivalent prime lens for a tight, centered composition at exact eye level to the button. Maintain razor-sharp focus across the entire surface and edge, with a gentle bokeh fall-off in the far background if any ambient elements are present. Set the aperture to around f/8 for crisp detail, and balance the exposure to preserve specular highlights and the luminous transparency of the tinted, liquid-like glass, while ensuring the solid background color renders cleanly and evenly.
