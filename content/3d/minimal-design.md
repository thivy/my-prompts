Generate a 3D icon image inspired by the attached image, preserving its exact color palette and faithfully replicating its geometry, lighting, and composition. Each render must maintain visual uniformity and precision, embodying the clean, minimal aesthetic characteristic of contemporary design.

### Visual Direction

The visual style is inspired by clean, minimal design, emphasizing simplicity and uniformity. Each output must maintain consistent form, lighting, and composition. Colors should be sampled directly from the reference image to preserve its unique character. All decorative elements—including logos, text, and numbers—must be excluded to maintain purity of form.

### Material, Lighting & Atmosphere

Materials should resemble original design elements, low-gloss finish. Lighting must follow a soft, top-left studio setup in the style of Cinema4D/Redshift, ensuring full white balance without artificial warmth. Highlights should be gentle and diffused. The background must be fully transparent, free of props, textures, or gradients. Shadows should be extremely soft, resembling ambient occlusion, with subtle grounding and no harsh cast shadows.

### Camera Setup

The camera should be positioned at an isometric angle, with the object perfectly centered and equal padding on all sides to ensure consistency. Each frame must feature a single object, never cropped, and rendered in a 1:1 square ratio.
